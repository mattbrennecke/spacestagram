# Spacestagram

A React App for viewing images from [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Spacestagram Locally

To run the Spacestagram app locally, first navigate to the project directory and run:

### `npm install`

This will install the necessary dependencies for Spacestagram. You only need to run this command once after cloning the project from the repository. After the required dependencies have been installed, you can start the app by running:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building Spacestagram for Production

To build the Spacestagram app for production, first navigate to the project directory and run:

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies required to build the app. Then run:

### `npm run build`

This script builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

See the React documentation about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
